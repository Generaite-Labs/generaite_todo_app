# Architecture

Summary of the key architectural decisions for your To-Do application:

1. Programming Language: C# (version 8) was chosen for its strong typing, prescriptive nature, and extensive online presence, which aligns well with using Large Language Models for code generation.
2. Frontend Framework: Blazor WebAssembly with Server-Side Pre-Rendering was selected to maintain a unified C# codebase and provide improved initial load times and SEO benefits.
3. Database: PostgreSQL was chosen as the primary database system for its open-source nature, performance, and advanced features.
4. ORM: Code-First Entity Framework Core was selected for seamless C# integration, automatic migration generation, and LINQ support.
5. Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity was chosen for its native integration with the ASP.NET Core framework and appropriate scale for the application.
6. Styling: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI was selected for rapid UI development, cross-platform compatibility, and leveraging the team's existing knowledge.
7. Architecture: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) was adopted as the project architecture to focus on the core domain, promote shared understanding between technical and domain experts, and provide a flexible, scalable structure that aligns with the chosen tech stack (C#, Blazor WebAssembly, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL).
8. API Design: A combination of REST API (using ASP.NET Core Web API) for standard HTTP-based communication and SignalR for real-time updates was chosen.
9. Logging: Serilog was selected as the logging framework, initially configured for console logging with the potential for future expansion.
10. State Management: Browser storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) was chosen for client-side state management in Blazor WebAssembly, with the potential to transition to IndexedDB as the application grows in complexity.
11. Input Validation: FluentValidation library was chosen for implementing validation logic, providing a consistent approach for both server-side and client-side validation in the C# backend and Blazor WebAssembly frontend. This decision promotes code maintainability, supports strongly-typed validation rules, and allows for future extensibility and localization.
12. Testing Strategy: A comprehensive testing approach was adopted, using xUnit as the primary testing framework, bUnit for Blazor component testing, and SpecFlow for Behavior-Driven Development. The strategy includes unit testing with DB mocks, minimal integration tests, end-to-end testing, and follows a Test-Driven Development approach. This decision aims to ensure reliability, maintainability, and quality across all layers of the To-Do application.
