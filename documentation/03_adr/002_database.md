# ADR: Selection of PostgreSQL as the Database System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our project requires a reliable, performant, and well-supported database system. We need a solution that aligns with our open-source philosophy and can handle the data requirements of our application efficiently.

## Decision

We have decided to use PostgreSQL as the primary database system for this project.

## Rationale

PostgreSQL was chosen for the following reasons:

1. Open Source: PostgreSQL is fully open-source, which aligns with our project philosophy and allows for community-driven improvements and support.

2. Performance: PostgreSQL is renowned for its excellent performance, especially for complex queries and large datasets, making it one of the most performant databases in the world.

3. Wide Support: PostgreSQL has extensive support in terms of tools, libraries, and community resources. This wide support ecosystem can significantly aid in development, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

4. Scalability: PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data and concurrent users, making it suitable for applications that may need to scale in the future.

5. ACID Compliance: PostgreSQL is fully ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

6. Advanced Features: PostgreSQL offers advanced features such as full-text search, JSON support, and extensibility through custom functions and data types.

7. Cross-platform Compatibility: PostgreSQL runs on various operating systems, providing flexibility in our deployment options.

8. Strong C# Integration: There are robust PostgreSQL drivers and ORMs available for C#, which aligns well with our chosen programming language.

### Alternatives Considered

1. MySQL:
   - While also open-source, it lacks some of the advanced features and performance optimizations of PostgreSQL.

2. Microsoft SQL Server:
   - Rejected due to licensing costs and less alignment with our open-source philosophy.

3. SQLite:
   - While lightweight and easy to set up, it lacks the robustness and advanced features required for a potentially scalable application.

4. NoSQL options (e.g., MongoDB):
   - Rejected because our application's data model is expected to benefit more from a relational database structure.

## Consequences

### Positive

- High performance and ability to handle complex queries efficiently.
- Strong data integrity and ACID compliance.
- Extensive community support and regular updates.
- Compatibility with our C# backend through well-maintained drivers and ORMs.
- Potential for advanced features as our application grows.

### Negative

- May require more initial setup and configuration compared to some simpler database systems.
- Could be overkill for very small-scale applications, though this is unlikely to be an issue for our project.

### Neutral

- Team members may need to familiarize themselves with PostgreSQL-specific features and best practices if they're more accustomed to other database systems.
- We'll need to ensure our hosting environment supports PostgreSQL or set up our own PostgreSQL server.
