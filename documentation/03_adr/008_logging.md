# ADR: Logging Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our To-Do application requires a logging solution to track application events, errors, and key flows. We need a flexible logging framework that can start simple but allow for future expansion.

## Decision
We will implement Serilog as our logging framework, initially configured to log to the console only.

## Rationale
- Serilog is a flexible and widely-adopted logging framework for .NET applications.
- It supports structured logging, which will be beneficial for future log analysis.
- Serilog easily integrates with ASP.NET Core and other .NET libraries.
- Starting with console logging provides immediate visibility during development and testing.
- Serilog's sink architecture allows easy expansion to other logging destinations in the future without changing the logging code throughout the application.

## Implementation Details
1. Add the following NuGet packages to the project:
   - Serilog
   - Serilog.AspNetCore
   - Serilog.Sinks.Console

2. Configure Serilog in the `Program.cs` file to use the console sink.

3. Set up appropriate log levels for different parts of the application.

4. Implement logging throughout the application, focusing on important events, errors, and key application flows.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Immediate logging capability for development and testing.
- Structured logging will make it easier to analyze logs in the future.
- Flexibility to add additional logging sinks or change configuration with minimal code changes.

### Negative
- Console logging alone may not be sufficient for production environments.
- Additional work will be required in the future to implement more comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions.

## Future Considerations
- Evaluate and implement additional Serilog sinks for file-based logging or centralized log management systems.
- Consider integrating with a full observability stack (e.g., ELK, Azure Application Insights) for production environments.
- Implement application performance monitoring and health checks.
