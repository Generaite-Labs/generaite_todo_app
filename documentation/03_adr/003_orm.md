# ADR: Selection of Code-First Entity Framework for Database Operations

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Having chosen C# as our primary programming language and PostgreSQL as our database system, we need to decide on an approach for database operations and object-relational mapping (ORM). We want a solution that integrates well with our technology stack and supports efficient development practices.

## Decision

We have decided to use Code-First Entity Framework (EF) Core for database operations and ORM in our project.

## Rationale

Code-First Entity Framework was chosen for the following reasons:

1. Seamless C# Integration: Code-First EF Core allows us to define our data models using C# classes, which aligns perfectly with our choice of C# as the primary language.

2. Database Agnostic: While we've chosen PostgreSQL, EF Core supports multiple database providers. This gives us flexibility if we need to change databases in the future.

3. Automatic Migration Generation: EF Core can automatically generate database migrations based on changes to our C# model classes, simplifying the process of evolving our database schema over time.

4. Type Safety: By using C# to define our models, we get compile-time type checking, reducing the risk of runtime errors related to data types.

5. Reduced Boilerplate: EF Core handles much of the database interaction code, reducing the amount of repetitive data access code we need to write and maintain.

6. LINQ Support: EF Core allows us to use LINQ for database queries, providing a consistent, strongly-typed way to query data that integrates well with C#.

7. Testability: The abstraction provided by EF Core makes it easier to write unit tests for our data access logic, potentially using in-memory database providers for testing.

8. Performance Optimization: EF Core includes features like lazy loading, eager loading, and query compilation, which can help optimize database performance when used correctly.

9. Rich Mapping Capabilities: EF Core provides a wide range of data mapping options, allowing us to handle complex relationships and inheritance scenarios in our domain model.

### Alternatives Considered

1. Database-First Approach:
   - Rejected because it would make it harder to version control our database schema and could lead to discrepancies between the database and code.

2. Dapper:
   - While lightweight and fast, it doesn't provide the same level of abstraction and automatic features as EF Core.

3. Raw SQL Queries:
   - Rejected due to increased development time, higher risk of SQL injection, and lack of ORM benefits.

4. Other ORMs (e.g., NHibernate):
   - While capable, they don't integrate as seamlessly with the .NET ecosystem as EF Core.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster development cycle due to automatic migration generation and reduced boilerplate code.
- Consistent data access patterns across the application.
- Strong integration with C# and LINQ, leveraging the team's existing skills.
- Flexibility to change the underlying database with minimal code changes.

### Negative

- Potential for performance overhead if EF Core features are not used judiciously.
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with EF Core concepts and best practices.
- Risk of generating inefficient queries if the ORM is not used correctly.

### Neutral

- Need to keep EF Core and its PostgreSQL provider updated to ensure compatibility and access to new features.
- May need to occasionally drop to raw SQL for very complex queries or performance-critical operations.
