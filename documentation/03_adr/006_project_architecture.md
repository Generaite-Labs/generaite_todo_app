# ADR: Adoption of Domain-Driven Design for Project Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we begin development of our To-Do application, we need to decide on an overall architectural approach that will guide the structure of our codebase. We want an architecture that focuses on the core domain of our application, promotes a shared understanding between technical and domain experts, and works well with our chosen tech stack (C#, Blazor WebAssembly, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL).

## Decision

We have decided to implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for structuring our project.

## Rationale

Domain-Driven Design was chosen for the following reasons:

1. Focus on Core Domain: DDD emphasizes understanding and modeling the core domain of the application, which is crucial for a task management system like our To-Do app.

2. Ubiquitous Language: DDD promotes the use of a shared language between developers and domain experts, improving communication and reducing misunderstandings.

3. Bounded Contexts: DDD's concept of bounded contexts allows us to manage complexity by dividing the domain model into distinct contexts with clear boundaries.

4. Rich Domain Model: DDD encourages the creation of a rich, behaviorally-complete domain model, which can lead to more maintainable and expressive code.

5. Separation of Concerns: DDD separates the domain logic from infrastructure concerns, promoting a cleaner architecture.

6. Alignment with Business Value: By focusing on the domain, DDD helps ensure that our technical decisions align closely with business goals and user needs.

7. Flexibility and Scalability: DDD's modular approach allows for easier scaling and adaptation to changing requirements.

8. Compatibility with Chosen Tech Stack: DDD principles can be effectively implemented with C#, Blazor, and Entity Framework Core.

### Implementation Overview

Our DDD implementation will include the following key components:

1. Domain Layer:
   - Entities: Core domain objects (e.g., Task, List, User)
   - Value Objects: Immutable objects without identity (e.g., TaskStatus, Priority)
   - Aggregates: Clusters of domain objects treated as a unit (e.g., TaskList with Tasks)
   - Domain Events: For capturing and communicating occurrences within the domain
   - Repository Interfaces: For data access abstraction

2. Application Layer:
   - Application Services: Orchestrating the execution of domain logic
   - DTOs: For data transfer between the domain and presentation layers

3. Infrastructure Layer:
   - Repository Implementations: Using Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL
   - External Service Integrations: If needed

4. Presentation Layer:
   - Blazor WebAssembly Components: UI implementation
   - View Models: Adapting domain models for the UI

### Alternatives Considered

1. Traditional N-Tier Architecture:
   - Rejected due to potential for anemic domain models and less focus on the core domain.

2. Clean Architecture:
   - While beneficial, it was deemed less focused on domain modeling compared to DDD.

3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
   - Considered as a potential addition to DDD in the future if the application's read/write operations become more complex.

4. Microservices Architecture:
   - Considered overly complex for our current project scale and requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong focus on the core domain, leading to a better alignment between code and business requirements.
- Improved communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders through ubiquitous language.
- More expressive and maintainable domain model.
- Clearer boundaries between different parts of the system.

### Negative

- Initial overhead in domain modeling and establishing ubiquitous language.
- Potential for over-engineering in simpler parts of the application.
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with DDD principles.

### Neutral

- May require more upfront analysis and design time.
- Need to carefully manage the complexity of the domain model as the application grows.
